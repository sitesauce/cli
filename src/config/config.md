> Why do I have a folder named ".sitesauce" in my project?
The ".sitesauce" folder is created when you link a directory to a Sitesauce site using the Sitesauce CLI.

> What does the "site.json" file contain?
The "site.json" file contains:
- The ID of the site that you linked ("siteId")
- The ID of the team your Sitesauce site is owned by ("teamId")

> Should I commit the ".sitesauce" folder?
No, you should not share the ".sitesauce" folder with anyone.
Upon creation, it will be automatically added to your ".gitignore" file.
